```{r include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
require(tigerstats)
require(tidyverse)

Fish = read.csv("Fish.csv")
Perch = filter(Fish, Species == "Perch")
Pike = filter(Fish, Species == "Pike")
Roach = filter(Fish, Species == "Roach")
```

# Predicting Fish Weight
```{r}
pwt = lm(Weight~ Length1+ Length2, data = Perch)
summary(pwt)
```
```{r}

```

From this graph I see that the best two predictors of wt for perch are Lengtht3 and height
## Perch

### Best Models

Best model for this class is using all four variables. 

### Best Two regressor model

From the graph the best two-parameter regressor model is based on length3 and Height. 

## Pike

### Best Models

### Best Two regressor model

## Roach

### Best Models

### Best Two regressor model
